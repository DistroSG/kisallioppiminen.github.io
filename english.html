		NARRATOR: The wise Sir Bedemir was the first to join King Arthur's
		knights, but other illustrious names were soon to follow:
		Sir Launcelot the Brave; Sir Galahad the Pure; and Sir Robin the
		Not-quite-so-brave-as-Sir-Launcelot who had nearly fought the Dragon
		of Agnor, who had nearly stood up to the vicious Chicken of Bristol
		and who had personally wet himself at the Battle of Badon Hill; and
		the aptly named Sir Not-appearing-in-this-film.  Together they formed
		a band whose names and deeds were to be retold throughout the centuries,
		the Knights of the Round Table.
