This course is a direct continuaton of the course [Object-Oriented Programming with Java, part I]({{ "/courses/2013/programming-part-1/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) (including week numbering). In Part II, we will dwell deeper into the world of object-oriented programming. The course includes comprehensive course materials and plenty of programming exercises, each tested using our automatic testing service [Test My Code](https://github.com/testmycode/tmc-server).

The course consists of six weeklys sets of tasks. The material is likely to contain minor errors such as poor error messages or faulty tests. Should you encounter these, please let us know!
