The course *Functional programming with Clojure* is an optional undergraduate course at the Department of Computer Science, University of Helsinki. This course is run by students of the department, as empowering our enthusiastic and skilled students to deliver courses has been our tradition.

This MOOC offered here is a completely unabridged version of the course offered to our students: the course's scope and material are identical to our own similar course. Completing the whole course yields 4 ECTS credits at our department. Students of the University of Helsinki should see the instructions [on this page](http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/en/courses/582343/2013/s/k/1) to complete the course for credit.
