**Welcome to [University of Helsinki](http://helsinki.fi/university)'s massive open online course (MOOC) on object-oriented programming!** 

During this course you will learn all the basics of computer programming, algorithms and object-oriented programming using the Java programming language. The course includes comprehensive course materials and plenty of programming exercises, each tested using our automatic testing service [Test My Code](https://github.com/testmycode/tmc-server).

**Anyone can join - no previous programming knowledge is required.**

Unlike many programming courses found online, ours is completely unabridged: the course's scope and material are **identical to our own CS1** programming courses. This first part consists of 6 sets of tasks, corresponding to the 6 weeks of effort in the course taught at [our department](http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/en).

This is the first course in our computer science learning track and we use industry strength tools from day one. Therefore the course is about programming in a real integrated development environment (IDE) and not in the browser or an educational IDE. The page '[How to get started](registration-and-how-to-get-started.html)' will explain the details for setting up all necessary tools.

After you are finished, go to [part II]({{ "/programming-part-2/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
