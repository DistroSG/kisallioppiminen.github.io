The MOOC has an IRC channel where you can discuss course topics and get support for the exercises from the course organizers as well as other participants. Much of the conversation on the channel is in Finnish but **don't be afraid to post your questions in English**.

If you are unfamiliar with IRC, you can reach our channel by using 3. party IRC clients:

- Mibbit: [Quickconnect](http://chat.mibbit.com/?server=ircnet.eversible.com&channel=%23mooc.fi)
- XS4ALL: [Quickconnect](http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/group/java/irc.html)

You can see the people on the channel on the right. Users with an @ sign in front of their nickname are course staff and channel operators. To send messages to the channel, just type it in the box at the bottom of the screen.

If you want someone to check your code for troubleshooting, **do not send multiple lines of code on the channel!** This is often hard to read and disrupts other conversation on the channel as well. Instead, use a text sharing service <http://paste.mooc.fi> or In **NetBeans, select TMC -> Send code to TMC pastebin**. Copy the link you receive and paste it to the conversation. You are encouraged to help other students on the IRC channel, but avoid handing out ready answers or "spoilers" to the exercises. Let others learn on their own as well!
