# NetBeans tips

1. Automatic System.out.println

	You can get the text System.out.println("") by typing sout and pressing the tabulator key (located to the left of the q key)

2. Automatic indentation

	NetBeans helps with the correct indentation. You can easily indent your program by pressing shift, alt and f simultaneously.

3. Autocomplete

	There is a really useful tool in NetBeans called auto-complete. If you have, for example, a variable String familyName;in your code, you do not need to always write it all. See what happens when you type and after that press ctrl and space simultaniously. Similarly NetBeans can auto-complete other names as well, for example to get the command while, you need to type only w and press ctrl and space...

4. Renaming

	Variables, methods and classes (that we learn about next week) need to have descriptive names. It is common that the selected name is not that describing and the need for changing the name arises. In NetBeans it is really easy to rename things. Just select and "paint" the name you want to change with the mouse. Then press ctrl and r simultaneously, then write the new name.

5. Generating an empty line below the current one

	You can make an empty line below the current line by pressing shift+enter at anywhere in a line

6. The automatic generation of constructors, getters and setters

	Go inside of the code block of the class, but outside of all methods and simultaneously press ctrl and space. If your class, for example, has an object variable balance, NetBeans will offer you the opportunity to generate the getter and setter methods, and a constructor that sets a starting value for the object variable.

7. Clean and build

	NetBeans occasionally loses track of changes made to a Java file and attempts to run a version of your program ignoring some recent changes you've made to your code. This often results in error messages during running the program or the TMC tests. In these cases, the Clean and build operation typically helps. You can find it in the "Run"-menu or by clicking the button with a hammer and a broom right above the code window. Clean and build removes the existing compiled version of the code and recompiles the source you currently have.
