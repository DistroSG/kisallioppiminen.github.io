# Completing and submitting the programming assignments

When you start NetBeans with TMC for the first time, the below window should open. If it does not open, you can find it from the TMC / Settings in NetBeans menu bar.

![tmc-settings]({{ "/img/programming/tmc-settings.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

Give the Username and Password that you gave during registration.

Press the button "refresh list" and select from "Current course" **{{include.course}}**.

By pressing "ok" the assignment "projects" are downloaded to your computer.
